Design Patterns 
	What are design patterns?
	Design patterns are standardized solution to real life complex industry problem when designing an application.
	For example:-
	When constructing an instance is quite costly you use creational design patten(example Singleton,Factory, abstractFactory,builder)
	When you want to reuse an instance and build new instance on top of that you use Structural design patten eg. Decorator design pattern

Types of Design Patterns

	1. Creational 
		a) It deals with creation of an object
	2. Structural 
		a) It deals with the composition of object. 
		b) More precisly what does a class contain? and what it's relationhip with other classes? Inheritance or composition 
	3. Behavioural 
		a) It deals with behaviour of object i.e. interaction between object <br/>


Structural Design Pattern:-

	Type:- 
	1. Proxy Pattern 
	2. Decorator Pattern 
	3. Facade Pattern 
	4. Adapter Pattern 
	5. FlyWeight Pattern 


Proxy Pattern:- 

	A proxy hides the  complexitiy involved in communicating with real object. An object that represent another object.
	E.g. A debit card is proxy to bank account.Any transation done by debit card result in decrease of amount in  bank account.
	Similarly, you have to program an interaction with other remote object. In such scenario, 
		1. you would create proxy to take care of all external communications 
		2. You would communicate with it as if it were residing in your local machine 
 	A good example is the EJB Home and Remote interfaces.
	Advantages:-
		1. Security: as direct access to real object is blocked
		2. As duplication of the object is avoided which may be huge in size an increase in performance can be obsered
	Disadvanatages:-
		1. Some client may access the real object and some may access the proxy this can cause dispartite behaviour
		

	
Decorator Pattern:-

	The decorator pattern allows us to add responsibilities to objects, dynamically.
	This allows user how they want to structure different classes to represent different combination 
	e.g. 
	1. Three classes Pizza, Topping(A,B,C,D,E,F ...), Size(Large, Medium,Small)
	Either you can have different types of toppings  class and provide them pizza like Atopping(Pizza), BToppings(Pizza) etc.
	Or have Topping(Pizza TypeOfTopping) i.e. composition.
	2. Real life programming example IO package of  java new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in)).
	Here system.in can be replaced by any input source.	The input source can be referred to by any stream resource
	You can use it with Buffer or not.

Facade Pattern:-

	A facade is a single class that represent an entire subsystem.
	E.g. An event manager which handles everything(food,decorations,inviting people etc.)
	Advantage of this pattern is that it
		1. It reduces network calls 
		2. It reduces coupling classes
		3. succeeds in establishing transaction boundry between communicating objects. 
	Facades like services, are good hubs to implement transaction

Adapter Pattern:-

	Adapter is used to match interfaces of different classes.
	Real life programming example Interservice calls when one service accepts data in xml and you have json you will convert it into xml.
	

FlyWeight Pattern:-

	A flyweight represents creating a fine-grained instance that is being used for efficient sharing.
	Cache an instance and use it again and again . Provided no update are being for a specific case.
	E.g. PSTN network(When a fixed set of telephone lines is being used by many customer but these are not utilizing the lines at the same time)
	JDBC Connection Pool is an example f FlyWeight when the set of  instance can be used to multiple times to execute the query
	Advantage:- reduces cost involved in creating and closing a connection.
